The code solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a brute-force approach by generating all 
possible permutations of the addresses and calculating the distance for each permutation. This 
method involves examining every possible combination, which can be computationally expensive and 
inefficient, especially as the number of addresses increases. Other approaches involving dynamic
programming, heuristics, and other specialized algorithms that can give an exact answer are better
suited for this problem.

This code uses the Google Maps API to find the optimal route among a list of addresses. It 
utilizes multiprocessing to speed up the calculations by concurrently processing multiple 
permutations. The code also includes caching mechanisms to store geocoding results and distance 
calculations, improving efficiency by avoiding redundant API calls.
