 All-In "Elimination"
 Used with prior knowledge (i.e. domain expertise).
 All features are used because it is known they fit for the model.
 Precursor to Backward Elimination.

 Backward Elimination: Step-by-Step Model Creation (Fastest) (or Stepwise Regression)
 1. Select a significance level to stay in the model (SL = 0.05)
 2. Fit the full model with all possible predictors
 3. Consider the predictor with the highest P-value.  If P > SL, go to next step.  Otherwise, model is complete.
 4. Remove the predictor.
 5. Fit model without this variable.  Go back to step 3.   

 Forward Selection: Step-by-Step Model Creation (or Stepwise Regression)
 1. Select a significance level to enter the model (SL = 0.05)
 2. Fit all simple regression models.  Select the one with the lowest P-value.
 3. Keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the one(s) you already have.
 4. Consider the predictor with the lowest P-value.  If P < SL, go to step 3.  Otherwise, model is complete. 

 Bidirectional Elimination: Step-by-Step Model Creation (or Stepwise Regression)
 1. Select a significance level to enter and to stay in the model e.g. SLENTER = 0.05, SLSTAY = 0.05
 2. Perform step 2 of Forward Selection (new variables must have P < SLENTER to enter)
 3. Perform step 3 of Backward Elimination (old variables must have P < SLSTAY to stay).  Go back to step 2.
 4. No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit.  The model is complete.

 All Possible Models (Score Comparison)
 1. Select a criterion of goodness of fit (e.g. Akaike criterion)
 2. Construct all possible regression models: 2 ^ N - 1 total combinations where N is  of features.
 3. Select the one with the best criterion.  The model is ready.
