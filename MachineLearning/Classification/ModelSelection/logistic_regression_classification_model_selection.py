# Logistic Regression Classifier
## Using the Sigmoid Function with Euler's number, solving for the dependent variable 'Y' in terms of the probability allows to model the solution with a linear equation.
## The solution is in terms of probability using the natural log - hence why it is called Logistic Regression.
# Assumptions when using Logistic Regression
## 1. Binary Logistic Regreesion requires the dependent variable to be binary. Ordinal Logistic Regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal.
## 2. Requires the observations to be independent of each other.
## 3. Requires little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables.
## 4. Requires that the independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
